                        If the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) is successful and put into use as planned, the average Ethiopian’s life would improve - not just because they would have access to electric power 24/7, but also because their country would have more foreign currency reserves that it can use to improve the lives of its citizens. The dam is a great accomplishment and it has a very strong case for internal use. The export part of the dam is also important, and while many may not realize it, it is linked to what Ethiopians celebrate when they praise the power of the dam.

            <p class="lg:px-28 text-lg leading-8 px-6">
                Ethiopia plans to increase its power exports to neighbouring nations by 900m$+ USD. Ethiopia’s current exports according to the US Department of Commerce are around 2bn$ USD. So the dam can have big implications for the economy. However, as good as the export plan sounds, exporting power can be difficult. Exporting power for Ethiopia isn’t necessarily going to be very straightforward. There are many political issues involving multiple countries; they argue that using a certain percentage of the dam is a threat to their sovereignty. There is also a question from some government bodies about spending a significant amount of our foreign reserves to build infrastructure for potential, not guaranteed, customers.

                Hypothetically, if part of GERD is repurposed to mine Bitcoin, it could potentially produce billions of dollars a year.

            Basically less than 5% of the dam can be used to power these machines, providing Ethiopia with alternate ways of turning power into revenue.
            </p>
            <p>
            This is only at a minimal capacity of GERD. <b>The dam at full capacity can power over ~200,000 similar machines, which would yield more than 41,900 BTC (~2bn$ yearly at current price).</b> 
            </p>

            <p>
            The mining equipment can be bought or it can be shared profit partnered with other miners and mining companies who are thinking of transitioning from other non-environmentally friendly mining methods such as coal & oil. Since Ethiopia has access to very cheap, almost zero cost, renewable electricity, for this purpose the mining capacity can slowly grow relative to the profits.
            These are very very high and promising numbers of hope. 
            Considering our current exports, a sudden multiplier to the exports with a very minimal financial & time investment but guaranteed outcome seems very attractive.

                    Ethiopia plans to increase its power exports to neighbouring nations by 900m$+ USD. Ethiopia’s current exports according to the US Department of Commerce are around 2bn$ USD. So the dam can have big implications for the economy. However, as good as the export plan sounds, exporting power can be difficult. Exporting power for Ethiopia isn’t necessarily going to be very straightforward. There are many political issues involving multiple countries; they argue that using a certain percentage of the dam is a threat to their sovereignty. There is also a question from some government bodies about spending a significant amount of our foreign reserves to build infrastructure for potential, not guaranteed, customers.

Before then, there was a period (unclear how long) when the US was pretending that you could exchange USD for gold when you could not. As long as you didn’t ask for too much gold, the US banks were happy to abide. But, because their supply did not match the number of papers they had secretly printed, President Nixon eventually had to formally announce that the US would no longer be giving Gold for USD. Officially backing the value of the currency by the promise of the government, allowing them to print as they pleased.

                Bitcoin, unlike fiat or other crypto, offers various avenues through which Ethiopia as a country can work around this; relying some of our energy and forex on an asset that is created to be at the mercy of the global free market, rather than at the mercy of few people’s hands. We will discuss three primary methods through which we believe Ethiopia as a country could benefit: Mining, Hodling, or seeing it as tender, and combined use.

                  <p>
                  If we as a country successfully mine Bitcoin, we wouldn’t need to sell them every time we mine them to find foreign currency liquidity. We could still use and own the bitcoins we have, lend them to liquidity providers, and borrow against them - this would be an automatic and instant process that can happen in traditional DeFi (Decentralized Finance). 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  A better way of saying that maybe: we could have the bitcoins, use them as collateral to get foreign currency of their worth, and then use this foreign currency to do whatever we want while we hold onto our Bitcoins.
                  </p>
                  <ul class="lg:px-8 px-4 flex flex-col space-y-1"> 
                    <li>- If we don’t pay back our debt to the liquidity provider, they will keep our Bitcoins.</li>
                    <li>- If we return the stablecoin FX liquidity to the lender, we get our Bitcoins back.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    So in the worst cases, defaulting on a debt wouldn't be much of an issue for the country because we would lose only our bitcoin collateral. But in the cases where we use our newly minted FX stablecoins to move our economy forward, when we pay back our debt, we get our bitcoins back and they presumably will only increase in value. So it's a win-win contract, especially for a country like Ethiopia.

                    We don’t have to hold every single mined Bitcoin. We understand Ethiopia needs to see the fruits of its mining asap.

                    According to a statement published by the Ethiopian government in 2018 & 2019, Ethiopia exports power to Djibouti and Sudan (up to 100 MW/each) with a combined annual revenue of less than 90m$ USD.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When comparing the revenue gained by exporting electricity to the revenue earned by bitcoin mining in Iran, Ethiopia might have produced four to six times the money (4-6x) by bitcoin mining instead of exporting electricity to neighboring nations, without even having to build complex and expensive infrastructure.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Selling power to neighboring countries is not necessarily scalable, as the countries are limited in how much they can spend on buying power. Djibouti for instance wants to buy a maximum of 400MW, and they don’t buy every hour of every day. Ethiopia doesn’t have to waste a single MW if it mined Bitcoin with it. Mining is perfectly scalable, each minute the energy is not being used for other purposes, it can be directed at more mining machines.

                    This section is not a new idea. It has been suggested various times, holding some BTC in a reserve is likely going to guard the ETB from slumping, more effectively than the plans the National Bank has been implementing and considering to our knowledge. The first mainstream suggestion about this that we know of came from an Open Letter to PM Abiy Ahmed, <a href="https://shinkurt.medium.com/an-open-letter-to-pm-abiy-ahmed-71a5a0a5a249" class="text-blue-300 hover:text-blue-500" target="__blank">where we tried to make the case for holding bitcoin when the price was nearing ~16,000$</a>.  
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    You may have read their article aimed at Abiy Ahmed, where they mention <b>"To maintain our buying power and import as much stuff as we did last year, our GDP growth rate needs to be much more than the inflation rate of the US Dollar."</b> 
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Given Ethiopia's economy is not growing remotely near 25% year after year, our buying power is naturally depleting quickly against scarce assets. If the Ethiopian economy is only growing 7% a year, we are not catching up to the rate we need to break even.
                  </p>

                  <div class="flex flex-col lg:flex-row justify-between items-center">

                        Right now, the public inflation rate of ETB is nearing 15%, and the apparent capital controls are only getting tighter. The National Bank is also seen trying to minimize the velocity of money by insisting and limiting people to make only a number of transactions per week. However, we at Project Mano believe this strategy is a double edged sword that will create more trouble for the banks, as people lose trust in the banks and take their money out. Simultaneously, since less money is stored and monitored by the National Bank, their ability to control and predict the economy only loosens. Bitcoin fixes this exact problem.

                        If Ethiopia buys and stores 1m USD worth of bitcoin today and bitcoin keeps performing according to its history, in 100 Years, it won’t lose 95% of its value like it does with USD, or like we would with any other cryptocurrency.

                    As a non-fiat, scarce, currency, Bitcoin provides a reliability that is unbeatable by fiat currencies and most other cryptocurrencies (including Ethereum - which is inflationary similar to fiat, unlike Bitcoin). <b>Its cryptographically secure hashing algorithm provides an absolute limit to how many coins can exist, so it will not lose value through supply inflation (the coin supply will never grow unlike Dogecoin, Ethereum, Fiat)</b>. As the monetary value of fiat currencies around the world shrink due to their arbitrarily ever-increasing monetary supply that is uncorrelated with the supply of resources, <em class="text-red-500">Bitcoin does the opposite;</em> maintaining its value and growing in worth when compared to its fiat counterparts, which will grow in supply.

                    Whether or not pursuing the plan of mining, we sincerely ask the Ethiopian government to put at least 1,000,000 USD or more into this digital asset and invest in its future generation and hold it for 50-100 years the same way National Bank holds Gold. We are asking NBE to consider holding very little Bitcoin the same way it does hold Gold. While USD is just paper and more can always be printed, that’s not true with Bitcoin. One is very clearly more valuable. We don’t have to do much - putting little of the USD could mean miraculous returns in a few decades.

                    The National Bank of Ethiopia holds multiple countries’ currencies, treasuries, and bonds as a reserve. Most of the holdings are USD, which makes sense since 80%+ world trade is in USD. However, the monetary supply in the US has been increasing by at-least 10% every year over the last decade. Unlike the government’s inflation estimate of 2%, the actual inflation rate, according to the increasing monetary supply, should be between 7–10%, every year. The inflation rate on long bonds should be way over the top, at a whopping 22%. This subsequently will result in Real Yield (RY) turning up at -10% for at least the next three years.

                El Salvador became the first country to start treating Bitcoin as legal tender. It means that within the country people can use it to buy and sell things legally, including but not limited to paying taxes and employees with it. This is a huge move as it helps Bitcoin get recognized as money under US and international Commercial Law where <a href="https://law.cornell.edu/ucc/1/1-201" target="__blank">Cornel states</a> "Money means any medium of exchange currently authorized or adopted as legal tender by a domestic or foreign government". 
              </p>
              <p>
                So a tender that is recognized in a forigen country as legal currency can be seen as foreign currency, which Central Banks (and commercial banks) can hold easily, as they can with any other foreign currency.

            This is the third and last resort we suggest for the National Bank before the Birr, and people’s valuable earnings fall in value because of monetary policies of another nation. Before recognizing Bitcoin as legal tender, we believe the government should attempt to back part of the currency with Bitcoin reserves. It doesn’t mean every single bank note has to be backed by a Bitcoin reserve, but overall, that the whole thing being somewhat backed by something verifiable on-chain, with cryptography. We believe this would increase the public’s trust in the currency, while minimizing a scarce mentality - and backing part of the currency with Bitcoin, still doesn’t prevent the government from printing more ETB. Which we believe is a win-win for the government and the public!
          </p>
          <p>
            It is, of course, plausible to imagine a future where all the above 3 suggestions are part of the economy - where Government mines Bitcoins (Part A), Holds them in a wallet to hedge FX inflation (Part B), borrow against the mined BTC to have easily accessible & sovereign FX reserve while holding the BTC, and allowing it as tender or backing part of the reserves with it (Part C). 
          </p>
          <p>
            An example portfolio can look like: 10% of mined coins can be sold once a month for FX Dollars, 10% can be put in DEFI for yield farming, and 40% can be used as collateral to borrow USD against, while another 40% held as BTC reserve.
